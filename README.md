# battleships
I am not author of the `spec.txt` file, it was taken from course PV248 - Python (Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, Brno, 2021)
as a homework specification for a prototype of an async battleship game.

Game is implemented according to rules in `spec.txt`.
There are also some examples of how to use the prototype in testing files.
